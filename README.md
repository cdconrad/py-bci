# py-BCI 0.0.2

An open source brain-computer interface program written in Python, 
originally created for the Dalhousie Surge Brainhack event in 2019. 
Py-BCI works using the MNE, scikit-learn and pygame and PsychoPy 
Python libraries. This version of the software includes a P300 speller 
BCI interface. Currently we only have an graphical interface that can 
only be used for data collection.

TODO:

1. Implement MNE's IO recording in the interface
2. Create a working implementation of xDAWN filtering and training
3. Pilot testing.

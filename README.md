# py-BCI 0.0.1

An open source brain-computer interface program written in
Python. Py-BCI works using the MNE, scikit-learn and pygame Python
libraries. This version of the software includes a P300 speller BCI
interface. Currently we only have an graphical interface that works
for the BCI paradigm.

TODO:

1. Create a train/test routine - DONE (currently prepared for offline recording)
2. Implement MNE's IO recording in the interface
3. Create a working implementation of xDAWN filtering and training
4. Pilot testing.
